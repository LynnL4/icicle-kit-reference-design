# PolarFire SoC Icicle Kit Reference Design Generation Tcl Scripts - Libero v12.5

## Description

This repository can be used to generate a reference design for the PolarFire SoC Icicle Kit. This reference design will have the same or extended functionality compared to the pre-programmed FPGA design on the Icicle Kit.
Libero SoC Tcl scripts are provided to generate the reference design using Libero SoC. These Tcl scripts have been tested using Libero SoC v12.5 and Libero SoC v12.5 SP1. For information on which script to run for each configuration see the "eMMC and SD cards" section.

## Using the Reference Design Generation Tcl Scripts

A script is provided for both eMMC and SD card configurations, previously eMMC and SD could only be used exclusively but updates now permit dynamic switching between eMMC and SD card. See the section "eMMC and SD Card switching" for more information.

1. Clone the repository - note the path to this repository must not contain any spaces
2. Open Libero v12.5
3. Open the execute script dialog (CTRL + U)
4. Execute the script for the design required (e.g "ICICLE_KIT_eMMC.tcl") - there are no arguments
5. The libero design will be created in the same folder as the script
6. Configure if required and run the flow to program a device

## Programming the FPGA

The scripts will automatically import IO constraints and generate timing constraints for the design. The flow can be run by double clicking on a stage in the design flow - selecting an option requiring previous steps to be completed will run the full flow, i.e double clicking "Run Program Action" will run synthesis, place and route, etc and then program the device.

## MSS Configuration
The Microprocessor Subsystem (MSS) is configured using the PolarFire SoC MSS Configurator.
This software tool takes user inputs and generates an MSS configuration file (.xml) along with an MSS component file (.cxz).
The XML file is used by the PolarFire SoC Configuration Generator to generate configuration header files for bare metal applications.
The MSS component file can be imported into a Libero design and used in the FPGA design flow.

A saved configuration for the PolarFire SoC MSS Configurator is available for both the eMMC and SD card designs in the "script_support" folder. These configurations will match the MSS configuration used in the design and can be used to regenerate XML and a Libero component.

## XML

The Microprocessor Subsystem (MSS) configuration is captured in an XML file that is then used by the PolarFire SoC Configuration Generator to generate configuration header files. These header files are compiled as part of the MPFS HAL startup code to configure the system on startup.

XML generated by both of the configurations provided is available in the "XML" folder.

## Programming the eNVM and setting the boot mode

If the eNVM is to be used (for example to store the HSS or a bare metal application) it can be programmed using SoftConsole v6.4 or later.

Build the application using the reference XML provided (XML will also be generated in the script_support/components/[target] folder when an MSS component is generated as part of the flow) and run the "PolarFire SoC program non secure boot mode 1" external tool in SoftConsole.

## eMMC and SD Cards

The PolarFire SoC Icicle Kit has the ability to use eMMC and SD cards as non-volatile storage. Linux builds and / or bare metal applications can be stored in a HSS payload which is in turn stored in non-volatile storage such as eMMC or SD cards. Using eMMC the user will have access to 8GB of on-board eMMC flash storage which can be programmed using the HSS. Using an SD card users can use the volatile storage capacity of the card, program it directly on their PC and quickly switch between cards to change the payload being run on a kit.

The SD card and eMMC cannot be used simultaneously as the MSS I/Os for the SD card and eMMC are muxed together. The Icicle Kit features a de-mux connected to these MSS I/Os, the de-mux is controlled by 2 select signals, called SDIO_SEL_{x}, which are connected to the FPGA fabric. When the select signals are low the de-mux connects the MSS I/Os to the eMMC controller, when the select signals are high the de-mux connects the MSS I/Os to the SD card controller.

### eMMC and SD card switching

In previous versions of this design the SDIO_SEL_{x} signals were tied low to enable eMMC or tied high to enable the SD card; this required re-programming the FPGA to switch between SD or eMMC configurations. The Icicle Kit reference design and MPFS HAL have been updated to support dynamically switching between these configurations without having to re-program the FPGA.

The SDIO_SEL_{x} signals are now driven by MSS GPIO_2 bit 0 - this bit resets to output low selecting the eMMC configuration by default. To select the SD card configuration, boot software must set MSS GPIO_2 bit 0 high and re-configure MSS I/Os as required.

HSS build v0.99.14 and greater has support for dynamic switching by re-configuring the MSS I/Os to select the SD configuration and setting GPIO_2 bit 0 high; it will then attempt to initialize an SD card. If this initialization fails (e.g card not inserted) the HSS will switch the MSS I/O configuration to eMMC and set GPIO_2 bit 0 low and attempt to initialize the eMMC.

**Note:** currently these updates are not fully supported by the Libero SoC design suite - to accommodate this the MPFS HAL will been updated with a define to allow dynamic switching. As a result of this we will continue to provide separate eMMC and SD card scripts to generate MSS XML for each configuration until Libero SoC has full support for these updates.
